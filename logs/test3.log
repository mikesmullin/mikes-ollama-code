[DEBUG: Started thinking mode]

Okay, the user wants me to create a man page file called cli.man in the ./docs directory. The man page needs a quick reference table listing scripts under ./actions/**/*.js and instructions to use --help for details. Let me break this down.

First, I need to find all the JavaScript files in the actions directory. The pattern is ./actions/**/*.js. I'll use the file_search function with that query to get the list of files. Once I have the list, I can extract the script names by removing the directory path.

Next, I have to structure the man page. The standard man page format has a .TH line for the title, then sections like NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, etc. The quick reference table should be in the SYNOPSIS or a dedicated section. I'll need to format the table with command names and brief descriptions, and include the --help instruction.

Wait, the user mentioned the table should be at the top. Maybe the NAME section is appropriate here. But the main content would be the quick reference. Let me check the man page structure. The NAME section is typically for the command name and a brief description. The SYNOPSIS shows the usage. Maybe the quick reference can be in the SYNOPSIS or a new section like "QUICK REFERENCE".

I need to make sure the commands are listed with their brief descriptions. Since the user wants the table at the top, perhaps the NAME section can have the table. Alternatively, use the SYNOPSIS to list the commands. Let me think. The NAME section is usually for the command name and a one-line description. The SYNOPSIS shows the usage. Maybe the quick reference table can be in a section like "QUICK REFERENCE" or "COMMANDS".

Alternatively, the user might want the table in the SYNOPSIS. Let me structure the man page with the NAME section for the CLI tool, then the SYNOPSIS showing the commands with their brief descriptions. Then the DESCRIPTION section can explain how to use --help for details.

So the steps are:

1. Use file_search to find all .js files in ./actions/**/*.js.
2. Process the list to get the script names (without paths).
3. Create the man page content with the quick reference table.
4. Write the content to ./docs/cli.man.

Wait, the user wants the table at the top. So the NAME section can have the table. For example:

.NAME cli
.SH NAME
cli \- Command Line Interface
.SH QUICK REFERENCE
.TS
tab(1) \ts
Command       Description
-------------- ---------------------
cmd1          Description of cmd1
cmd2          Description of cmd2
.SH DESCRIPTION
...

But the exact formatting might vary. Alternatively, use a table in the SYNOPSIS section.

But I need to format the man page correctly. Let me check the standard man page structure. The NAME section is for the command name and a one-line description. The SYNOPSIS shows the usage. The DESCRIPTION provides more details. The quick reference table can be in the SYNOPSIS or as a separate section.

Alternatively, the user might want the table in the DESCRIPTION section, but the instruction says to list the scripts under ./actions/**/*.js and instructions to use --help. So the main content should be the list of commands with their brief descriptions, followed by a note to use --help for details.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Use file_search to get all .js files in ./actions/**/*.js.
2. Extract the base names (without the path) of these files.
3. Determine the command names. Assuming each script corresponds to a command, maybe the base name without .js is the command. For example, if there's ./actions/script1.js, the command is script1.
4. Create a man page with each command listed in a table, including their descriptions (maybe brief, like "Run script1").
5. Include instructions that users can run the command with --help for more details.

Wait, the user mentioned "scripts under ./actions/**/*.js" and instructions to run --help for details. So each script is a command, and the table lists them with the command name and a brief description (like "Execute script1").

But the user may not have provided descriptions for each command. So perhaps the table just lists the command names and a generic description like "Run the script".

So, the man page would have a section listing each command with its name and a brief description, then a note to use --help for details.

Now, the actual steps:

First, find all the .js files in ./actions/**/*.js.

Then, extract the command names (assuming the script's base name is the command, like if actions/script1.js, then the command is script1).

Then, create the man page with the NAME section, then the SYNOPSIS with the table, then the DESCRIPTION with --help instruction.

But I need to generate the content. Since the user wants the table at the top, maybe the NAME section can have the table. Alternatively, create a new section for the quick reference.

Let me proceed. First, call file_search with the query **/*.js in the ./actions directory.

Once I have the list, I can process each file path to get the command name. For example, if the file is ./actions/script1.js, the command is script1.

Assuming each script corresponds to a command, the table would list them.

Now, the man page content would be:

.TH cli 1 "October 2023" "1.0" "User Manual"
.SH NAME
cli \- Command Line Interface
.SH QUICK REFERENCE
.TS
tab(1) \ts
Command       Description
-------------- ---------------------
script1       Execute script1
script2       Execute script2
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cli tool provides various commands for different actions. To get detailed help for a specific command, run \fB--help\fP.
.PP
For more information about a specific command, use \fB--help\fP.

But I need to format the table correctly in the man page. The .TS is for table start, then the columns. But I'm not sure about the exact formatting. Alternatively, use a simple list.

Alternatively, the user might accept a markdown-like table, but the man page uses troff formatting. The correct way is to use the .TS and .TP macros.

But maybe the user just wants a simple table, so I'll proceed with that.

So the steps are:

1. Call file_search for **/*.js in actions directory.
2. Process the list to get the command names.
3. Generate the man page content with the list.
4. Write the content to ./docs/cli.man.

Now, I need to make sure that the file_search is called with the correct query. The path is ./actions/**/*.js, so the query is "**/*.js".

Wait, the file_search function's query parameter is a glob pattern. So the correct query is **/*.js, which matches all .js files in any subdirectory of the actions directory.

Once I get the list, for each file path, extract the command name. For example, if the file is ./actions/script1.js, the command is script1.

Assuming that the script name without the .js extension is the command name. So, I'll process each file path to split the name.

Once the list is obtained, create the man page content with the table.

Now, the actual function calls:

First, call file_search with query **/*.js in the actions directory.

Then, use the results to generate the man page content.

Then, create the file ./docs/cli.man with that content.

So the first step is to perform the file_search.
